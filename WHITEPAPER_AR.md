## Executive Summary

يقدم هذا العمل Secondary Resonance كإطار مفاهيمي جديد،
مدمج في استمرارية فيغا ونموذج بيانات الرنين.
يصف Secondary Resonance نهجًا يركز على المعنى يحدد الصلة من خلال الرنين
بدلاً من التشابه. يتبع هذا العمل بشكل صارم VSP – بروتوكول سلامة فيغا.

## 1. Introduction

This white paper introduces **Secondary Resonance** as a formal conceptual contribution within the Vega Continuum and Resonance Data paradigm.

The work is embedded in a meaning-first approach where:
- Meaning precedes mechanism
- Resonance defines relevance
- Temporal coherence indicates wisdom
- Decision emerges through resonance collapse

---

## 2. Definition

**Secondary Resonance** is a conceptual construct within the Vega ecosystem that:

- Operates in the resonance-based meaning space
- Maintains coherence across abstraction levels  
- Integrates with VTC (Vega Time Crystal) concepts
- Follows VSP (Vega Safety Protocol) guidelines

## 3. What This Is

✔ A conceptual framework  
✔ A formal definition  
✔ A contribution to resonance-based systems  
✔ Prior art for intellectual property  
✔ Academic publication material

## 4. What This Is NOT

✘ NOT an algorithm  
✘ NOT source code  
✘ NOT system architecture  
✘ NOT implementation details  
✘ NOT business logic  
✘ NOT a claim of new physics  
✘ NOT a claim of consciousness

## 5. Integration with Vega Ecosystem

### 5.1 Resonance Data (RD)
Secondary Resonance extends the Resonance Data model by providing additional conceptual vocabulary for meaning representation.

### 5.2 QIRC (Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing)
The concept operates within QIRC's framework of superposition, interference, and collapse.

### 5.3 VTC (Vega Time Crystal)
Secondary Resonance maintains temporal coherence as modeled by VTC's conceptual framework.

### 5.4 RQL (Resonance Quantum Layer)
As part of the Resonance Quantum Layer, Secondary Resonance contributes to the meaning-ordering structure.
